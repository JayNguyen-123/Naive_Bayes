# Naive_Bayes
Naive Bayes classifiers are a collection of classification algorithms based on Bayes’ Theorem. It is not a single algorithm but a family of algorithms where all of them share a common principle, i.e. 
every pair of features being classified is independent of each other. 
Bayes’ Theorem:
Bayes’ Theorem finds the probability of an event occurring given the probability of another event that has already occurred. Bayes’ theorem is stated mathematically as the following equation:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A)*P(A)) / P(B)
Where 
  P(A) is the priori of A (the prior probability, i.e. Probability of event before evidence is seen). The evidence is an attribute value of an unknown instance(here, it is event B).
  P(B) is Marginal Probability: Probability of Evidence.
  P(A|B) is a posteriori probability of B, i.e. probability of event after evidence is seen.
  P(B|A) is Likelihood probability i.e the likelihood that a hypothesis will come true based on the evidence.
